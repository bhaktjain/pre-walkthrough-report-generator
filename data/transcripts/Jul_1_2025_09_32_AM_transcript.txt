Hello, this Federico.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:32 AM
Hey, Ferrari karma from chapter calling. How are you doing?

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:32 AM
 Good Mastermind, how are you?

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:33 AM
 Good. Thank you. You contacted us regarding the renovation at 55 West, 16th Street, apartment, number nine  And yeah, I just moment and discuss the project with you, get some more information about what exactly you're trying to do what state you're in and yeah, just a timeline that you're looking at and just Global works. So maybe you can just tell me a little bit more about the project and then I have any questions left out

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:33 AM
 I'll take it from there.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:33 AM
 Yeah. So  The stage I'm in right now is I'm into being a few different design, construction terms. So we  where there's a good fit, what I want to do is  Is one, we do the kitchen.  Two is created glass wall to create a little bit of an office space. It's a very open like lost type thing and I want to create a okay, nice glass wall. They can kind of hold and close up the office space.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:34 AM
 Um, I want to change toilets.  Um, and then install a new air conditioning units.  Like Central, I see, there's a central. I see all the ductwork is done, which is the system is pretty old and I want to see if we can install a new system.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:34 AM
 Okay.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:34 AM
 And I can try a couple other small things here and there but I'm forgetting, yeah, maybe the redoing the pain. Like we have a pantry room. That's why like read more than I think that time to be nice.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:34 AM
uh,  and for the kitchen, I'm looking at it right now on the on the street easy pictures.  Are you looking to keep everything as is? I see that there's like a move like the kitchen island. That's movable. Do you want to have a physical kitchen island? Or do you want to keep that? Like, as it is with a

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:34 AM
 Like a temporary one or are you looking to to add a kitchen island or something like that. And in terms of the  The kitchen. Are you also looking to relocate anything or keeping everything with an existing location?

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:35 AM
 Yeah, I think there's there's two tasks. There's one pathway is just like hey let's just have the cabinets and move it a little bit, I don't know that. I mean, I think we should see what that looks like. And what that would say, I think the other path is to just do the whole thing.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:35 AM
 Remove the like temporary thing. I don't, I don't think I want to kitchen island there. I think there's enough space.  But there's there's a few formats I think that probably would work. Well, we have like an l and anyways we move we create cabinets by the wall.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:35 AM
 Yeah.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:35 AM
 And then maybe we put the fridge by the wall and like any with movements around get a bigger fridge.  Maybe, you know, we need to check the electrical. That's why you're guidance to come in and look at it, you know, can we actually put an induction oven instead of a gas oven like anyone, so bunch of little things like that.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:35 AM
 Okay, and in terms of timeline, do you have a specific timeline when you want to start the project? Are you aiming for for a start for a specific, start date? Or are you just in the initial stages?

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 I want construction. Yeah, I want the construction to be done, essentially. What's it called between November and March?

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
Okay.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Leave the apartment and go somewhere else and if we can do it then that's ideal.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Okay, perfect.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Which gives us a bunch of times.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Yeah, absolutely. And in terms of the co-op board, are they very strict when it comes to Renovations? Or are they relatively easy going?

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Not.  Know they're gonna be pretty easy ones.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Okay, perfect. Um,  and do you have a number in mind that you want to stay below to get this overall project done? Or are you a little bit in the dark?

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:36 AM
 Well, that's a good question. I don't have a good answer to that. I want to see, like, what's I think? It probably depends on like, what we do, right? So, so that's why I'm trying to get a few quotes again and understanding for like, okay, like what are the different options to do this? What do different firms charge and and have someone with a design? I come look at it and come with good ideas. You know like hey we could do this.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:37 AM
 Okay, um, so just to give you some context. When we do a kitchen renovation, we usually have a starting price summer in the 55 to 60k area, roughly. And then with the other work that will add on top of that.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:37 AM
 I we would have to see because it's not like cold bath and renovation. You're only want to do some partial stuff. So what we can do is we can

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:37 AM
 Schedule a walk through on-site. We'll meet you take some measurements. Also for the creation of the glass wall and to see how much linear square feet there is and everything else. It needs to be done and then we have a better idea about the scope of work and that allows us to put together a timeline and an accurate estimate.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:37 AM
I think that's smart and and someone they can do the walk through. That has a design perspective because they may come up with better ideas that I'm not thinking about.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 Exactly, exactly.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 And then the yeah and I think look I think that that's when you say that price, that that excludes appliances and material.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 Appliances. So we do include standard Cabinetry and countertop in it. We do not include the appliances because there's such a huge range. We have we have our own cabinet manufacturer here in the United States that you can then customize. We can do a fully custom kitchen. We can do standard Cabinetry, we can do standard semi Customs so we offer you a lot of variety when it comes to the Cabinetry.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 Hey, what's up?

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 and,

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 Hey sir, you just got that up for a second but yeah, I think I think you were saying you have your own Cabinetry maker  and we can kind of customize those. Yeah.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 Exactly.  Exactly.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:38 AM
 So,  yeah, so that's so that's it. 55 includes the Cabinetry and I mean, high level. This is high level.  And then you get these determine sit and then the piece on top of that is the appliances are not included in that.

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:39 AM
 Exactly.  Correct.

(303) 882-0911 | Jul 1, 2025 09:39 AM
 oh yeah, one we have used come over and

Massimo Pizzulli | Jul 1, 2025 09:39 AM
